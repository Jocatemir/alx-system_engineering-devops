Issue Summary:
Duration: May 8, 2023, 10:00 AM - May 8, 2023, 2:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The online payment service was inaccessible, resulting in a significant disruption for users. Approximately 75% of users experienced issues accessing the payment functionality, leading to failed transactions and frustrated customers.

Timeline:

10:15 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in failed API requests related to the payment service.
10:20 AM: The incident was escalated to the on-call engineer, who began investigating the issue.
10:30 AM: Initial investigation focused on the payment service's server infrastructure, assuming a potential network or server misconfiguration.
11:00 AM: Debugging efforts expanded to analyze the application codebase and database interactions, suspecting a software bug or database bottleneck.
12:30 PM: Further analysis revealed no conclusive evidence of infrastructure or code issues, leading to a redirection of focus to external dependencies.
1:00 PM: The incident was escalated to the backend engineering team and the third-party payment gateway provider for collaboration on troubleshooting efforts.
1:30 PM: It was identified that a recent update in the third-party payment gateway's API caused compatibility issues, resulting in the disruption.
2:00 PM: The incident was resolved by rolling back the payment gateway integration to the previous stable version, restoring the service's functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was traced to an incompatibility between the updated version of the third-party payment gateway API and the integration within our web stack. The API changes introduced unexpected behavior, leading to failures in processing payment requests. The issue was resolved by reverting the integration to the previous stable version, restoring compatibility and resolving the disruptions experienced by users.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar outages and improve the system's overall resilience, the following actions will be taken:

Conduct thorough compatibility testing: Implement a robust testing strategy to ensure compatibility between third-party service updates and our web stack, focusing on critical functionalities such as payment processing.

Enhance monitoring capabilities: Implement proactive monitoring for API integrations, enabling faster detection of any compatibility issues or disruptions.

Establish clearer communication channels: Improve communication channels with third-party service providers, enabling prompt collaboration during incidents to expedite the resolution process.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Develop an automated testing suite to validate the compatibility of third-party API updates with our system.
Implement a canary deployment strategy to safely roll out third-party service integrations, allowing for controlled monitoring of their impact on system stability.
Enhance monitoring infrastructure to capture and analyze key metrics related to payment processing and API interactions.
Establish a communication protocol with third-party providers, including designated points of contact for incident response and collaboration.
Conduct post-incident reviews to share lessons learned and incorporate them into ongoing improvement efforts.
By implementing these measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to fortify our system's resilience, minimize the risk of similar incidents, and ensure uninterrupted service for our users.
